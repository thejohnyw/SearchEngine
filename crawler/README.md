### Compilation

To compile, simply `make` in ../common; then `make` again in this directory.

### Testing

To test, simply `make test`.
See `testing.out` for details of testing on 3 sites and edge cases and an example test run.

To test with valgrind, `make valgrind` but `testing.out` already has a valgrind test

### Cleaning

To clean/remove files produced by Makefile, simply `make clean`
